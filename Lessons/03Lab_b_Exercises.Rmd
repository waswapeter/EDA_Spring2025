## Set up the session
```{r Setup}
#Import packages
library(tidyverse); library(lubridate); library(here)

#Check workspace
here()

#Import data
pm25 <- read.csv(
  #----ENTER THE FILENAME HERE, USING THE here() PACKAGE----
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE,
  colClasses = c("Site.ID"='factor')
)

#Fix the date
pm25$Date <- mdy(pm25$Date)

```


## Explore properties of the dataframe
-   How many different sites are included in the data set?
-   What is the mean daily PM2.5 concentration?
-   In what units of are PM 2.5 concentrations reported?

```{r Explore the data}
# Compute the number of different sites


# Compute the mean and median PM 2.5 concentration


# What are the units


# What is the date range (min and max dates)

```


## Plot distribution of values

-   Number of samples using each different source 
-   Distribution of daily mean concentration values
-   Distribution of daily mean concentration, by source*
  *   There are multiple ways to visualize this...

```{r}
#Number of samples using each different source 


#Distribution of daily mean concentration values


#Distribution of daily mean concentration, by source



```
